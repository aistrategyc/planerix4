# Ads & Marketing Pages - Real Data Integration Success Report

**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED AND DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION
**Commit**: eed8ec0 (feat: Integrate real ITstep data into /ads and /marketing pages)

---

## Overview

Successfully integrated real advertising and marketing campaign data from the ITstep analytics database (itstep_final) into both `/ads` and `/marketing` pages. The pages now display live production data instead of mock data.

---

## Implementation Summary

### Backend Changes

#### 1. New API Endpoints Created

**`/api/ads-manager`** (apps/api/liderix_api/routes/ads_manager.py):
- GET /api/ads-manager - List advertisements with metrics
- GET /api/ads-manager/stats - Aggregated ad statistics
- Data source: `raw.fb_ad_insights` + `dashboards.campaign_reference`
- Returns: ad_id, ad_name, campaign info, impressions, clicks, spend, CTR, CPC

**`/api/marketing-campaigns`** (apps/api/liderix_api/routes/marketing_campaigns.py):
- GET /api/marketing-campaigns - List marketing campaigns
- GET /api/marketing-campaigns/stats - Aggregated campaign statistics
- Data source: `dashboards.v5_leads_campaign_daily` + `dashboards.campaign_reference`
- Returns: campaign_id, campaign_name, platform, leads, CPL, impressions, clicks, spend

#### 2. Pydantic Schemas (apps/api/liderix_api/schemas/ads.py)

New schemas added:
- `AdMetrics` - Advertising metrics structure
- `AdRead` - Advertisement data model
- `AdStatsResponse` - Aggregated ad statistics
- `CampaignMetrics` - Campaign metrics structure

#### 3. Route Registration

Updated `apps/api/liderix_api/main.py`:
- Registered ads_manager router at `/api/ads-manager`

#### 2. Updated /ads Page (apps/web-enterprise/src/app/ads/page.tsx)

Replaced 1,183 lines of mock data with 355 lines of real API integration:
- Real-time data fetching from /api/ads-manager
- Loading states and error handling
- Platform filtering (Google/Meta)
- Search functionality
- Statistics cards showing real metrics
- Responsive ad cards with detailed metrics

#### 3. Updated /marketing Page (apps/web-enterprise/src/app/marketing/page.tsx)

Replaced 1,042 lines of mock data with 354 lines of real API integration:
