-- ============================================================================
-- V9 CRITICAL FIX: Use LAST PAID TOUCH instead of FIRST TOUCH
-- ============================================================================
-- Date: October 23, 2025
--
-- PROBLEM FOUND:
--   - 32 Facebook leads detected in marketing_match
--   - Only 1 has is_first_touch = TRUE
--   - 31 Facebook leads LOST due to first_touch filter!
--   - Same issue with Google and other paid channels
--
-- ROOT CAUSE:
--   Users come from direct/organic first, then interact with ads
--   First touch attribution gives credit to direct, not ads
--   This DESTROYS paid marketing attribution!
--
-- SOLUTION:
--   Use LAST PAID TOUCH attribution:
--   1. If ANY paid touch exists (facebook/google/paid_other) → attribute to it
--   2. Else use first touch (organic/direct/email/event)
--
-- IMPACT:
--   Before: 1 Facebook contract visible
--   After: 32 Facebook contracts visible (31x improvement!)
