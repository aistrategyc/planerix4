## 🔧 Problem Found and Fixed

### Issue: Missing v6 Endpoints in data-analytics Router

**Root Cause:**
Frontend calls `/api/data-analytics/sales/v6/*` and `/api/data-analytics/contracts/v6/*` but these endpoints were only registered in `/api/analytics/*` router.

**Solution:**
Created two new files with v6 endpoints:
- `apps/api/liderix_api/routes/data_analytics/sales_v6.py` (251 lines)
- `apps/api/liderix_api/routes/data_analytics/contracts_v6.py` (445 lines)

Updated `data_analytics/__init__.py` to register new routers with correct prefixes.

**Git Commit:**
- Hash: `480698e`
- Message: "fix: Add missing v6 endpoints to data-analytics router"
