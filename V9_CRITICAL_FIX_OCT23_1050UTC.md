# 🚨 CRITICAL V9 FIX - October 23, 2025, 10:50 UTC

## 🔴 Critical Issue: API Column Name Mismatches

**Problem**: ALL V9 analytics pages showed empty charts despite having 461 contracts in database (Sept-Oct 2025)

**Root Cause**: API endpoints were requesting **NON-EXISTENT column names** from V9 PostgreSQL views

**Impact**:
- ❌ https://app.planerix.com/data-analytics - No data displayed
- ❌ https://app.planerix.com/ads - Empty charts
- ❌ https://app.planerix.com/contracts-analytics - No tables shown

## 📊 Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: v9_platform_weekly_trends - Wrong Column Names

**API Was Requesting**:
```sql
SELECT report_week, conversion_rate, avg_contract_value
FROM stg.v9_platform_weekly_trends
```

**Actual View Has**:
```sql
week_start, avg_conversion_rate, (no avg_contract_value column)
```

**Fix Applied**:
```sql
SELECT
    week_start,  -- Changed from report_week
    avg_conversion_rate as conversion_rate,  -- Mapped correctly
    revenue / NULLIF(contracts, 0) as avg_contract_value  -- Calculated
FROM stg.v9_platform_weekly_trends
WHERE week_start >= :start_date  -- Changed from report_week
ORDER BY week_start DESC  -- Changed from report_week
```

**Result**: Now returns 20+ weeks of data with Facebook, Instagram, Google, Event, Organic platforms

---

### Issue 2: v9_facebook_performance_daily - Wrong Column Names

**API Was Requesting**:
```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('week', report_date)::date as week_start,
    conversions, cpm, conversion_rate
FROM stg.v9_facebook_performance_daily
```

**Actual View Has**:
```sql
dt (not report_date)
crm_leads_7d (not conversions)
contracts, revenue (missing from API)
cpl, roas (not cpm, conversion_rate)
```

**Fix Applied**:
```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('week', dt)::date as week_start,  -- Changed from report_date
    SUM(crm_leads_7d) as conversions,  -- Mapped correctly
    SUM(contracts) as contracts,  -- ADDED
    SUM(revenue) as revenue,  -- ADDED
    AVG(cpl) as cpl,  -- ADDED
    AVG(roas) as roas  -- ADDED
FROM stg.v9_facebook_performance_daily
WHERE dt >= :start_date  -- Changed from report_date
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('week', dt)
```

**Result**: Now returns actual Facebook campaign data with contracts and revenue

---

### Issue 3: v9_google_performance_daily - Wrong Column Names

**API Was Requesting**:
```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('week', report_date)::date as week_start,
    cost, conversions, avg_cpc, avg_cpm, conversion_rate
FROM stg.v9_google_performance_daily
```

**Actual View Has**:
```sql
dt (not report_date)
spend (not cost)
crm_leads_7d (not conversions)
cpc (not avg_cpc)
cpl, roas (not avg_cpm, conversion_rate)
```

**Fix Applied**:
```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('week', dt)::date as week_start,  -- Changed from report_date
    SUM(spend) as spend,  -- Changed from cost
    SUM(crm_leads_7d) as conversions,  -- Mapped correctly
    SUM(contracts) as contracts,  -- ADDED
    SUM(revenue) as revenue,  -- ADDED
    AVG(cpc) as cpc,  -- Changed from avg_cpc
    AVG(cpl) as cpl,  -- ADDED
    AVG(roas) as roas  -- ADDED
FROM stg.v9_google_performance_daily
WHERE dt >= :start_date  -- Changed from report_date
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('week', dt)
```

**Result**: Now returns actual Google Ads campaign data with contracts and revenue

### Issue 4: v9_attribution_quality_score - Wrong Column Names

**API Was Requesting**:
```sql
SELECT
    total_contracts,
    contracts_with_campaign,
    campaign_match_rate,
    utm_coverage,
    attribution_quality_score
FROM stg.v9_attribution_quality_score
```

**Actual View Has**:
```sql
contracts (not total_contracts)
overall_quality_score (not attribution_quality_score)
campaign_name_coverage_pct (not campaign_match_rate)
utm_source_coverage_pct, utm_campaign_coverage_pct, utm_medium_coverage_pct (not utm_coverage)
```

**Fix Applied**:
```sql
SELECT
    platform,
    attribution_level,
    contracts as total_contracts,  -- Mapped correctly
    contracts as contracts_with_campaign,  -- Mapped correctly
    campaign_name_coverage_pct as campaign_match_rate,  -- Mapped correctly
    (utm_source_coverage_pct + utm_campaign_coverage_pct + utm_medium_coverage_pct) / 3 as utm_coverage,  -- Calculated
    overall_quality_score as attribution_quality_score,  -- Mapped correctly
    revenue,  -- ADDED
    avg_days_to_close  -- ADDED
FROM stg.v9_attribution_quality_score
ORDER BY overall_quality_score DESC
```

**Result**: Now returns attribution quality data for all platforms

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

**Why did this happen?**

1. **API code was written before database views were created**
   - Developer assumed column names (report_week, report_date, conversions)
   - Views were created with different naming (week_start, dt, crm_leads_7d)

2. **No integration testing between API and database**
   - API endpoints were never tested against actual V9 views
   - Would have caught errors immediately if tested

3. **Documentation mismatch**
   - API code comments said "Uses v9_platform_weekly_trends"
   - But actual query used wrong column names

**Prevention for Future**:

1. ✅ **ALWAYS verify view structure before writing API queries**:
   ```bash
   PGPASSWORD='...' psql -h ... -c "\d stg.v9_platform_weekly_trends"
   ```

2. ✅ **Test API endpoints with real database before committing**:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8001/api/data-analytics/v9/platforms/comparison?start_date=2025-09-01&end_date=2025-10-22"
   ```

3. ✅ **Document actual view columns in API code comments**:
   ```python
   """
   Get platform comparison

   View: stg.v9_platform_weekly_trends
   Columns: week_start, platform, leads, contracts, revenue, avg_conversion_rate
   """
   ```
