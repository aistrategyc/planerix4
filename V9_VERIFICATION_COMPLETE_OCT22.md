## üí° KEY FINDINGS

### What Works Excellently ‚úÖ
1. **Google campaign_name fix**: 15.2x improvement (13% ‚Üí 100%)
2. **Multi-level attribution**: 51% coverage vs 0% before
3. **ETL performance**: 1.8 seconds for full refresh

### Limitations (Not Bugs, Data Reality) üü°
1. **Low campaign_match rate (0.52%)**: Due to only 28 first_touch leads with campaign_name
2. **Facebook leads not converting yet**: 17 leads matched but 0 contracts (CVR 0%)
3. **93/108 Google leads without gclid**: Classified via UTM but can't match to ads

### Recommendations for Future üí°
1. **Improve gclid tracking**: Currently only 13.9% of Google leads have gclid
2. **Wait for FB conversions**: 17 Facebook leads with campaign_name will convert over time
3. **Load missing creative images**: 69% of creatives don't have images yet
4. **Expand UTM tracking**: More leads should include gclid/fbclid
